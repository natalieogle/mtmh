  OMG, you guys! I bought a house! Well technically the bank bought it, but I guess I'm supposed to pay them back?<br>¯\_(ツ)_/¯
</p>
<p>
  After some serious Pinteresting and dreaming the past few months, I finally have the house keys and am ready to get to work. The house was built in 1928 so it already has some of that old-world charm, but it's going to be even cuter when I'm done with it! Well, that's the plan. This could also end up being a huge Pinterest fail.

  I made this blog to document my projects for myself and anyone else who may find it helpful (I love before and after pics). I'm going to be doing most everything by myself, although I do plan on soliciting the help of my mum, daddy, or hired handyman, if needed. I'm also not really a fan of spending my own money, so I'm going to try to spend the least amount of money possible to get the job done. And done right!

  To give you an idea of what's coming, just think of beadboard (lots of beadboard), crown moulding, tin square ceilings, barn wood, corrugated metal, refinished cabinets, tile backsplashes, fireplace makeover, and upcycled furniture and lighting!
