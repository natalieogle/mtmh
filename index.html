  OMG, you guys! I bought a house! Well technically the bank bought it, but I guess I'm supposed to pay them back?<br>¯\_(ツ)_/¯
</p>
<p>
  I made this blog to document my house projects for myself and anyone else who may find it helpful...and I love before and after pictures! I'm going to be doing most everything by myself, although I do plan on soliciting the help of my mum, daddy, or hired handyman, if needed. I'm also not really a fan of spending my own money, so I'm going to try to spend the least amount of money possible to get the job done right.

  So far I've put a beadboard ceiling and new crown molding up in the living room and dining room. I also have a chandelier makeover to share! Check out those <a href="{{ site.url }}/posts"> posts</a>!

  I'm currently in the process of putting up board and batten in the dining room and working on a fireplace makeover. I also have the tin ceiling squares for my bedroom ceiling but need to paint them first. After that I will be putting up shiplap on the office ceiling and putting crown molding in both my bedroom and the office. Then I will attack the bathroom and kitchen!
